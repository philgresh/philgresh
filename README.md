Hi there, my name is Phil Gresham. I'm a software engineer and new dad living in the SF Bay Area who loves traveling, tinkering with projects around the house, and reading hard sci-fi.

**I'm currently looking for my next opportunity**, where I'd love to contribute my skills to making a positive difference in the world. If your company is hiring a senior engineer, or if you know of a great position that's opening up, I'd love to chat! Please feel free to reach out to me if you would like to open a conversation.

  - I'm currently working on [an app](https://github.com/philgresh/tsunami-alert-gcp) to notify participants of tsunami events that may affect them. A CRON job checks for any updates from a government RSS feed, parses the feed and related XML documents, and then sends a text to participants if the tsunami might affect their area. The stack includes a Firebase backend using Realtime Database, Cloud Functions, and Twilio for SMS, and a React frontend. The project also requires revamping an [open-source library](https://github.com/philgresh/cap-ts) which I will eventually sundown as I make contributions to the original library.
